# App 0 Manager - Client App System using ZeroMQ library

## Two separate applications are developed for this system, one which is the App 0 Manager and the other a Client App program

This is an example of how ZeroMQ messaging library can be used to exchange files between two connected system(s). Three important specifications to be aware of are

* "App 0 Manager”– should be able to send and receive messages with any client App (“Client App 1”, “Client App2”, ...., “Client App {N}” )
* “Client App 1” – can send and receive messages from “App 0 Manager”
* “Client App 2” – can send and receive messages from “App 0 Manager”
* “Client App {N}” – can send and receive messages from “App 0 Manager”


```python To run program
console.log('Code Tab A');
